It is part of the week-long commemoration and celebration of Lobo Foundation Anniversary that usually ends on the 29th day of September – the feast day of St. Michael the Archangel. Various activities such as Alay-Lakad, Kasalang Bayan, Entertainment Night, Job Fair, Agri-Trade Fair, Search for Miss Lobo Pageant, Street Dancing Competition, Float Parade, Search for Anihan Festival Queen, Cultural Presentation and Fluvial Procession are being celebrated. These activities or events are being participated in by LGU, students from both private and public secondary schools, senior high school, elementary school pupils of the district, and other private individuals whose active involvement is so excellent. The contingent’s' outfits were made from crude materials from items which Lobo is known for. The innovative outfits were decorated and made from buli, corn, coconut husk, anahaw leaf, and shells. A large portion of the outfits were likely designed with atis-inspired props. The participants could make use of popular music to dance to. Each school’s best dancers take time and effort to lead other pupils to dance using modern choreography. Hours would be spent perfecting the dance and stunts routine. Props too add color and excitement to their presentations and to rival competitors. The plethora of sights and sounds of the Anihan Festival draws crowds of thousands to the town plaza to watch the event. Adding color to the festivity are the parade of creatively designed floats, with muses of competing tribes, and the Search for Anihan Festival Queen.",
